I was recently inspired by [@csswizardry](http://csswizardry.com/2012/12/a-new-css-wizardry/)'s post on migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll, with hosting on gihub pages. I've decided to follow suit, mostly because learning new things is what I do best.

I learn best by seeing things in action and then deconstructing them, so feel free to explore/steal/improve upon anything [here](https://github.com/sudojesse/sudojesse.github.com).
