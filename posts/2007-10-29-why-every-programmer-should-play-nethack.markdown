title: CSS Wizardry—a realignment
---

After quite some time with version three of CSS Wizardry being live and not really changing I decided that it was time I did something with it. I was more than happy with the design—it had received some nice responses—however I thought the code could be neatened up somewhat. I decided to maintain as much of the previous design as possible and add Wordpress as a CMS.

After two nights work I managed to port most of the styles over and get the bulk of the site functioning perfectly, moving copy across bit by bit. Despite a couple of minor flaws I am, on the whole, very impressed with Wordpress.

Now hopefully I'll be a little more inclined to update the site—something I've been pretty slack with of late...
